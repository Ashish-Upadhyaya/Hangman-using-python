# Hangman Game

## Overview

This is a Python implementation of the classic word-guessing game, **Hangman**. The game challenges players to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters or entire words within a limited number of attempts. It includes difficulty levels (`easy`, `medium`, and `hard`) and hints for each word to enhance gameplay.

The project consists of two files:
1. **`hangman.py`**: Contains the main game logic.
2. **`words.py`**: Contains a list of words and their corresponding hints.

This README provides detailed instructions on how to play the game, its features, and how to set it up locally.

## Features

- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose between three difficulty levels:
  - **Easy**: Words with â‰¤ 5 letters.
  - **Medium**: Words with 6â€“8 letters.
  - **Hard**: Words with > 8 letters.
  
- **Hints**: Each word comes with a hint to help players guess the word.

- **Interactive Gameplay**:
  - Guess individual letters or the entire word.
  - Request hints during gameplay by typing `hint`.

- **Dynamic ASCII Art**: Displays the hangman's state based on remaining attempts.

- **Replayability**: Option to restart the game after finishing a round.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Prevents invalid inputs (e.g., numbers, empty strings).
  - Handles duplicate guesses gracefully.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**:
   - Run the `hangman.py` script.
   - Select a difficulty level (`easy`, `medium`, or `hard`).

2. **Guess the Word**:
   - The game displays a hidden word as underscores (`_ _ _ _`) and provides a hint.
   - Enter a letter or the full word to make a guess.

3. **Use Hints**:
   - Type `hint` during your turn to see the hint again.

4. **Win or Lose**:
   - You win by guessing all the letters or the full word correctly.
   - You lose if you exhaust all six attempts.

5. **Replay**:
   - After finishing a round, choose whether to play again or exit.

---

## Game Rules

- Players have **6 attempts** to guess the word.
- Each incorrect guess reduces the number of remaining attempts.
- Correctly guessed letters are revealed in the word.
- Duplicate guesses do not count against the player but will notify them.
- If the player guesses the word correctly before losing all attempts, they win.
